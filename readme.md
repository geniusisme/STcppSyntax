STCppSyntax
===========

This is plugin for Sublime Text 3, which concentrates on C++ syntax.

Syntax is not only highlighting, but some other things, too. For example, for symbols extraction. ST uses particulary named syntax constructs for symbol extraction. This plugin provides such for classes and functions ( methods included ).


Usage
-----

Create folder "C++" in your plugins folder, and pull this repo there. Then restrart all copies of Sublime. You will end up with syntax highlighting in your c++ files and with extracted symbols in your projects. Some highlighting features needs special threatment, so standard color schemes will not highlight everything this plugin provides. Soon the example tmTheme will be provided.
